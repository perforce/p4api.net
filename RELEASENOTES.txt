                           Release Notes for
                P4API.NET, the Helix P4API for .NET

                          Version 2023.2

Introduction

        This document lists all user-visible changes to P4API.NET
        between release 2011.1 and this release

        Perforce numbers releases YYYY.R/CCCCC, e.g. 2002.1/30547.
        YYYY is the year; R is the release of that year; CCCCC is the
        bug fix change level. Each bug fix in these release notes is
        marked by its change number. Any build includes (1) all bug fixes
        of all previous releases and (2) all bug fixes of the current
        release up to the bug fix change level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important End-of-Life Notice

    Cross platform support was provided with the 2021.2 release of P4API.NET.
    Since then, 4 different Nuget packages were published ('p4api.net.core',
    'p4api.net', 'p4api.net.x64' and 'p4api.net.x86'). But as 'p4api.net' 
    contains all the necessary libraries to work on all these 4 platforms, there
    is no need for 4 different packages. Hence, this major release marks these
    packages - 'p4api.net.core', 'p4api.net.x64' and 'p4api.net.x86' - as 
    deprecated. We recommend using the 'p4api.net' package to avoid deprecation
    warnings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation

    The simplest way to install P4API.NET is using the NuGet package manager. 
    The P4API.NET package can be found here - 
    https://www.nuget.org/packages/p4api.net
    
    More details and other options can be found in the user guide - 
    https://www.perforce.com/manuals/p4api.net/Content/P4API_NET/release-compatibility-prereqs.html#Installation
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building P4API.NET from Source

        The official version of P4API.NET exists as source on:
        https://github.com/perforce/p4api.net
        
        Instructions for building are in the BUILD.md file which can be found
        here - https://github.com/perforce/p4api.net/blob/master/BUILD.md

        To build the help file project (p4api.net.shfbproj) you will need
        the Sandcastle Help File Builder from http://shfb.codeplex.com/.

        SSL support
        -----------

        P4API.NET supports SSL connections, and requires linking with SSL 
        libraries.

        Executables linked against the P4API libraries must also be linked
        against real OpenSSL libraries: The latest 3.0.x patch is recommended.
        Use the OpenSSL libraries as mentioned in BUILD.md.

        P4API.NET is now dependent on NLog (http://nlog-project.org/). The
        related package will be installed automatically by Visual Studio
        if the NuGet Package Manager is installed and has
        http://nlog-project.org/ specified as a Source.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility Statements

        Server Compatibility

          You can use this release of P4API.NET with any release of the
          Perforce server at or later than 2018.1, but to ensure maximum
          compatibility, it is recommended that you use it with the
          corresponding Perforce server release

        API Compatibility

          This release of P4API.NET requires the 2023.2 Helix Core API
          (2023.2/2519561) for C/C++ (P4API), built with Visual Studio 2019 or 
          later.

        C#/.NET Compatibility

          This release of P4API.NET, when built from source using 
          p4apicore.net.sln, is compatible with '.NET Framework 4.6.2',
          '.NET 6.0' and '.NET Standard 2.0'. Other .Net Framework, .NET Core
          and .NET Standard versions might work, but are not supported.

        Platform Compatibility

          While P4API.NET is generally usable on Windows, Linux and MacOS 
          platforms, the release is certified only on the following platforms:

          Windows
            Windows 10
            Windows Server 2019
            Windows Server 2022
          Mac OS X
            MacOS 12.2
          Linux
            Ubuntu 20.04

        Compiler Compatibility

          Details regarding compiler compatibility can be found in the source 
          code markdown (.md) files i.e. p4api.net\BUILD.md and 
          p4api.net\p4bridge\P4Bridge.md

        Compatibility with Previous Releases

          Unless otherwise stated below, this release of P4API.NET is compatible
          with previous releases from Perforce Software.

        Known Limitations

          The p4api.net.chm help file that is distributed with
          p4api.net64.zip, p4api.net86.zip, and p4api.net-src.zip needs
          to be Unblocked by clicking on the file->Properties and checking
          the [] Unblock checkbox. Otherwise no content will appear when
          the file is opened.

            Version.Date is now correctly parsed in
            FromGetServerMetaDataCmdTaggedOutput. The date will still be
            in the format M/D/YYYY 12:00:00 AM as a DateTime object always
            shows time. If the end user only wants the date, they can use

        #1880486 (Job 79134) *
            GetProtectionTable(Options options) has been obsoleted in

        #1880408 (Job 84053) *
            Default values have been added for Options, SubmitOptions,

        #1880376 (Job 72025) *
            GetStream(string stream, string parent, Options options) has
            been obsoleted. Parent argument was redundant. It has been
            replaced with GetStream(string stream, Options options).

        #1879924 (Job 79425) *
            Repository.GetJob() no longer returns a job that does not
            exist on the server, it will now return null. GetJob("") will
            return a new job.

        #1879905 (Job 100191) *
            GetConfigFile() now uses GetConfigs() and returns the first

            GetProtectionEntries will now return exclusionary lines
            when run with AllUsers flag. The ProtectionEntry now returns
            an unmap bool to indicate if the path is excluded.

        #1833938 (Job 99016) *
            GetProtectionEntries now returns correct ProtectionMode
            for =open, =read, =branch, and =write permissions.

        #1833797 (Job 99009) *
            GetProtectionEntries will no longer fail with -M or -m flags.
            Those options are no longer available in
            GetProtectionEntriesCmdFlags. A GetMaxProtectionAccess method
            has been added to be used with
            GetMaxProtectionAccessCmdOptions and
            GetMaxProtectionAccessCmdFlags which contain the -M or -m
            flags.

        #1820145 (Job 99131) *

        1526478 (Job 69159) *
            There is now a single and multi-threaded version of P4Server.

            Single=threaded -> only one p4 TCP connection, which needs to
            locked and managed on its own (e.g. LastResult) in a MT
            application.
            Multi-threaded -> each request from a different thread gets
            its own TCP connection; this is not thread pooling, each
            thread has a dedicated TCP connection.

            The now unused enviro and connectionmanager implementations
            have been removed.
